# MathLib Client

This is the repository of the front end client for the full stack web application, MathLibz. The source code & readme for the server side can be found [here](https://github.com/nathanjpak/MathLib-server#readme), while the API can be found [here](https://github.com/nathanjpak/MathLib-API#readme)

This application used React as its main front end framework, along with react libraries to manage some components. For example,

- [React-Hook-Form](https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form) was used to manage forms.
- [React-Modal](https://github.com/reactjs/react-modal) and [SweetAlert2](https://github.com/sweetalert2/sweetalert2) were used in conjuction to manage various modals.
- [Better-React-Mathjax](https://github.com/fast-reflexes/better-react-mathjax) was used to render LaTeX.

Additionally, [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) was used to handle fetching data from the server and API.

## How to run

The client was bootstrapped by [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). If you have npm installed, you can run the following commands:

`npm install && npm run start`
